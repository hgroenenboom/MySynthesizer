My synthesizer is build based on the code I received from Marc Groenewegen en Ciska Vriezinga. Im trying to code al the synthesis elements myself. At this moment the filenames are non-logically named. This will be my next improvement. For now the program should be run by running audiotest.py

So far I've made a: ADSR, Amplifier, Averagefilter with LP & HP, A buffer, White Noise, FM, AM, Sine, Additive Saw, Pulse and stereo compatibility.

I aim to find out how I can improve the code itself and how I can improve my coding skills and my conceptual knowledge of these synthesis elements in a digital system.
