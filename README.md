My synthesizer is build based on the code I received from Marc Groenewegen en Ciska Vriezinga. Im trying to code al the synthesis elements myself. The program should be ran by running MySynthesizer\MySynthesizer. Python 3.6 or later is needed.

So far I've made a: ADSR, Amplifier, Averagefilter with LP & HP, A buffer, White Noise, FM, AM, Sine, Additive Saw, Pulse and stereo compatibility. The filters are still under costruction.

I aim to find out how I can improve the code itself and how I can improve my coding skills and my conceptual knowledge of these synthesis elements in a digital system.
